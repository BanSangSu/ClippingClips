# Tech Stacks
- **Flutter, Papago API, PHP, RSelenium(R crwaling)**


# Features
1. Provide random clips each time you enter.
2. When you search in Korean, Papago Translator(Naver) will translate it to English and find it in the Database and show results in this app.
3. You can save the clips in your own personalised notebook when you press the plus(+) button.
4. Use STT(Speech To Text) to check your pronunciation.


# To do
1. Change the algorithm for serving random clips to one based on user interest data.
2. To improve performance, we need to develop search algorithms on the server and Database where we put data like clips and user data.
3. Update UI design so that when you press the save button, a thumbnail of the image appears in your own personalised notebook, and when you press a clip in your own notebook, you can watch the big size video with subtitles.
4. Use STT to test a sentence about the clips that you watch and make scores. And I want to display some statistics as to results.
5. Change the server to make it safety and utility, because right now server is implemented easily and simply in PHP.
